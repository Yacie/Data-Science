# # Introduction
# 
# This notebook illustrates how to access a DB2 database on Cloud using Python by following the steps below:
# 1. Import the `ibm_db` Python library
# 1. Enter the database connection credentials
# 1. Create the database connection
# 1. Close the database connection
# 
# 
# 
# __Note:__ Please follow the instructions given in the first Lab of this course to Create a database service instance of Db2 on Cloud and retrieve your database Service Credentials.
# 
# ## Import the `ibm_db` Python library
# 
# The `ibm_db` [API ](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ibm_db/) provides a variety of useful Python functions for accessing and manipulating data in an IBMÂ® data server database, including functions for connecting to a database, preparing and issuing SQL statements, fetching rows from result sets, calling stored procedures, committing and rolling back transactions, handling errors, and retrieving metadata.
# 
# 
# We first import the ibm_db library into our Python Application
# 
# Execute the following cell by clicking within it and then 
# press `Shift` and `Enter` keys simultaneously
# 

# In[1]:


import ibm_db


# When the command above completes, the `ibm_db` library is loaded in your notebook. 
# 
# 
# ## Identify the database connection credentials
# 
# Connecting to dashDB or DB2 database requires the following information:
# * Driver Name
# * Database name 
# * Host DNS name or IP address 
# * Host port
# * Connection protocol
# * User ID (or username)
# * User Password
# 
# 
# 
# __Notice:__ To obtain credentials please refer to the instructions given in the first Lab of this course
# 
# Now enter your database credentials below and execute the cell with `Shift` + `Enter`
# 

# In[2]:


#Replace the placeholder values with your actual Db2 hostname, username, and password:
dsn_hostname = "dashdb-txn-sbox-yp-lon02-01.services.eu-gb.bluemix.net" # e.g.: "dashdb-txn-sbox-yp-dal09-04.services.dal.bluemix.net"
dsn_uid = "xwz43222"        # e.g. "abc12345"
dsn_pwd = "lmdf@nnszhl7zsj9"      # e.g. "7dBZ3wWt9XN6$o0J"

dsn_driver = "{IBM DB2 ODBC DRIVER}"
dsn_database = "BLUDB"            # e.g. "BLUDB"
dsn_port = "50000"                # e.g. "50000" 
dsn_protocol = "TCPIP"            # i.e. "TCPIP"


# ## Create the DB2 database connection
# 
# Ibm_db API uses the IBM Data Server Driver for ODBC and CLI APIs to connect to IBM DB2 and Informix.
# 
# 
# Lets build the dsn connection string using the credentials you entered above
# 

# In[4]:


#DO NOT MODIFY THIS CELL. Just RUN it with Shift + Enter
#Create the dsn connection string
dsn = (
    "DRIVER={0};"
    "DATABASE={1};"
    "HOSTNAME={2};"
    "PORT={3};"
    "PROTOCOL={4};"
    "UID={5};"
    "PWD={6};").format(dsn_driver, dsn_database, dsn_hostname, dsn_port, dsn_protocol, dsn_uid, dsn_pwd)

#print the connection string to check correct values are specified
print(dsn)


# Now establish the connection to the database

# In[5]:


#DO NOT MODIFY THIS CELL. Just RUN it with Shift + Enter
#Create database connection

try:
    conn = ibm_db.connect(dsn, "", "")
    print ("Connected to database: ", dsn_database, "as user: ", dsn_uid, "on host: ", dsn_hostname)

except:
    print ("Unable to connect: ", ibm_db.conn_errormsg() )


# Congratulations if you were able to connect successfuly. Otherwise check the error and try again.

# In[6]:


#Retrieve Metadata for the Database Server
server = ibm_db.server_info(conn)

print ("DBMS_NAME: ", server.DBMS_NAME)
print ("DBMS_VER:  ", server.DBMS_VER)
print ("DB_NAME:   ", server.DB_NAME)


# In[7]:


#Retrieve Metadata for the Database Client / Driver
client = ibm_db.client_info(conn)

print ("DRIVER_NAME:          ", client.DRIVER_NAME) 
print ("DRIVER_VER:           ", client.DRIVER_VER)
print ("DATA_SOURCE_NAME:     ", client.DATA_SOURCE_NAME)
print ("DRIVER_ODBC_VER:      ", client.DRIVER_ODBC_VER)
print ("ODBC_VER:             ", client.ODBC_VER)
print ("ODBC_SQL_CONFORMANCE: ", client.ODBC_SQL_CONFORMANCE)
print ("APPL_CODEPAGE:        ", client.APPL_CODEPAGE)
print ("CONN_CODEPAGE:        ", client.CONN_CODEPAGE)


# ## Close the Connection
# We free all resources by closing the connection. Remember that it is always important to close connections so that we can avoid unused connections taking up resources.

# In[8]:


ibm_db.close(conn)


# ## Summary
# 
# In this tutorial you established a connection to a DB2 database on Cloud database from a Python notebook using ibm_db API.
